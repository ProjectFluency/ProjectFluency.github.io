                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p> There are 23 million adults in the United States with limited English proficiency, 90% of them immigrants. For them, language limits day-to-day life, access to jobs they are otherwise skilled for, even the ability to help their kids succeed in school.  </p>

                <p> The current solution, ESL (English as a Second Language) courses, only enroll 4% of the population in need, and are notorious for poor quality--only 40% of ESL students make progress year-to-year. Technology-based language learning programs are designed for a very different audience--much more suitable to short-term travel rather than long-term life. </p>

                <h4>Our Mission</h4>

                <p> We need to do better. </p>
                <p> Project Fluency helps immigrants working in service jobs turn everyday workplace interactions into learning opportunities. In order to do this, we need to create a feeling of safety so people with limited proficiency can begin having conversations in English. </p>

                <h4>The Solution</h4>

                <p> We help small groups self-administer a brief curriculum focused on informal conversation, and augment it with SMS-based behavioral nudges, leading to real-world interactions in English. The result is a positive feedback loop that improves both confidence and proficiency over time. </p>
